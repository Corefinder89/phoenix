# Continuous integration, continuous deployment

The documentation is based on using **Jenkins** to setup the ci-cd process.

## Continuous integration

**Continuous integration (CI)** is the **practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project.** It's a primary DevOps best practice, allowing developers to frequently merge code changes into a central repository where builds and tests then run.

## Continuous deployment

**Continuous Deployment (CD)** is a **software release process that uses automated testing to validate if changes to a codebase** are correct and stable for immediate autonomous deployment to a production environment.
